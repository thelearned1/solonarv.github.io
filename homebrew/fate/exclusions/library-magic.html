        <h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>Library mages form bonds with (the <em>genius loci</em> of) libraries. A genius loci is formed via an extended ritual performed to designate a volume of space and the works (books, images, music, and so on) within as a library. The genius loci’s personality is based on the works contained in the library as well as its creator(s), and it retains a special bond with its creator.</p>
<p>The strength of a genius loci varies depending on the size, variety, rarity, and significance of the library’s collection, as well as the number and strength of its bonds to library mages.</p>
<h3 id="warped-space">Warped Space</h3>
<p>Libraries with a powerful enough genius loci may have various space-warping effects appear within and around them. Common effects are “bigger on the inside”, hidden entrances, and portal doorways.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<h3 id="half-cost-discount">Half-cost discount</h3>
<p>Purchasing a level in a Library Magic skill costs 50% less XP if the new level is less than your highest Library Magic skill level.</p>
<h3 id="library-bond">Library Bond</h3>
<p>Single-cost skill. You have a different Library Bond skill for each library you have bonded with. To increase the level of a Library Bond skill, a prolonged visit to that library is necessary.</p>
<p>Each library provides bonded mages a different set of abilities, which become more versatile and powerful as the bond strengthens - i.e. the corresponding Library Bond skill increases in level.</p>
<p>The maximum level of a Library Bond skill is based on the strength of that library’s genius loci.</p>
<h2 id="rituals">Rituals</h2>
<p>Library mages manage their bonds to libraries through a handful of lengthy magical processes confusingly called rituals (no relation to <a href="ritual-magic.html">ritual magic</a>).</p>
<h3 id="entering-the-library">Entering the Library</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration: 10 minutes to several hours</li>
<li>Requirements: Must be performed inside the library. Genius loci must approve.</li>
</ul>
<p>You bond with a library and its genius loci, allowing you to use its magic. If you are already bonded, you strengthen your bond, allowing you greater access to the library’s magic. Spend XP to increase the level of your Library Bond skill for this library. This ritual might involve anything from simply communing with the genius loci, through helping out with library tasks, all the way to gifting/loaning it rare books or other works. The duration and difficulty of the ritual scale with the previous level of Library Bond as well as the amount of levels added.</p>
<h3 id="severing-the-bond">Severing the Bond</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration: 5 minutes</li>
<li>Requirements: Must be performed inside the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>You sever your bond with a library and its genius loci. You lose all levels of your Library Bond skill for this library. You regain some of the XP spent on those skill levels. If you part on good or neutral terms with the genius loci, you regain 3/4 of the XP spent. If you part on bad or hostile terms, you regain only half.</p>
<h3 id="expanding-the-collection">Expanding the Collection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration: variable</li>
<li>Requirements: Must be performed inside the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>You add one or more works (books, art, music, …) to the library’s collection. Storing the works in their proper place is part of the ritual, as is explaining their content and the purpose of the addition to the genius loci.</p>
<h3 id="culling-the-collection">Culling the Collection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration: variable</li>
<li>Requirements: Must be performed inside the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>You remove one or more works (books, art, music, …) from the library’s collection. This is not a loan: after the ritual is complete, these works are no longer part of the library’s collection. The ritual involves explaining your removals to the genius loci, retrieving the works from their current location, and then bringing them physically outside the library.</p>
<h3 id="altering-the-premises">Altering the Premises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration: variable</li>
<li>Requirements: Must be performed inside or just outside the library. Building materials may be needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>You expand, shrink, or otherwise remodel the building the library sits in. This ritual includes changes both to the outer boundaries and the interior, as well as altering the library’s space-warping effect if the genius loci is powerful enough for such an effect to be present.</p>
