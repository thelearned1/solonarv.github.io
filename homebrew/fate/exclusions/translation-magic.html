        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Translation magic allows its users to understand information recorded in any language and nearly any format, as well as communicate in nearly any mode. They are even able to understand and speak the language of creation, allowing them to manipulate the script that underlies all reality.</p>
<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<h3 id="script-insight">Script Insight</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: Peer Underneath</li>
</ul>
<p>Single-cost skill. Represents your understanding of, and ability to manipulate, the Script.</p>
<p>Whenever you level up this skill, you may learn an additional Script Trick or upgrade an existing one. You may use Tricks from the <a href="#script-tricks">list below</a> or make up new ones in conjunction with your QM.</p>
<h3 id="ontological-weight">Ontological Weight</h3>
<p>Single-cost skill. Represents your importance in the order of things, which affects how much you are able to manipulate the script. Many tricks have an effect that scales with your Ontological Weight skill or Aspect Bonus, and Ontological Weight affects how much you are able to use your tricks.</p>
<h2 id="stunts">Stunts</h2>
<h3 id="universal-translator">Universal Translator</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost: 250 XP</li>
</ul>
<p>You understand any information in written, spoken, or other form, so long as it is not encrypted. Additionally, you speak and write all languages.</p>
<h3 id="peer-underneath">Peer Underneath</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requirements: Universal Translator, a glimpse into the underpinnings of reality</li>
<li>Cost: 100 XP</li>
</ul>
<p>You have glimpsed the script that underlies reality, and your universal understanding of information allowed you to grasp what you saw. You have begun to unravel the secrets of the script.</p>
<p>Unlocks the <a href="#script-insight">Script Insight</a> skill.</p>
<h2 id="script-tricks">Script Tricks</h2>
<h3 id="influence-pool">Influence Pool</h3>
<p>Your ability to influence reality is limited. It is represented by a numerical Influence Pool. Your influence pool’s capacity is equal to (Ontological Weight * 10), and it refills completely over the course of a day or so.</p>
<p>Casting Script Tricks strains your influence pool, depleting a number of points equal to the trick’s Strain.</p>
<h3 id="script-trick-design">Script Trick Design</h3>
<p>Script trick design is an adapted form of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdE1lGoRnzj4HIuzlYdDq18FTYZ5s-Qxa1Mt0NR_cQM/edit#heading=h.osa3zs7b5q0">Fated to Die’s jutsu creation rules</a>. The main change is that the Strain numbers on jutsu aspects are divided by 10, and casting cost is simply equal to the total Strain.</p>
<p>The rules will be detailed here in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Strain:</strong> 4 (range: +0, +1, +2, +3)</p>
<p>You create a telepathic bond between yourself and your allies, allowing you to communicate silently and through barriers. If an ally is further away than (Ontological Weight * Script Insight * 20) meters, their bond to you breaks and they are no longer able to communicate telepathically.</p>
