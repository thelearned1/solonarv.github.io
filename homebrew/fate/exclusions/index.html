        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><em>Exclusions</em> is a setting (or rather a setting template) filled with a great variety of magic systems. Crunch is provided using a variant of the FATE rules.</p>
<p>The rules are detailed in <a href="concepts.html">Concepts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="differences-from-fate">Differences from FATE</h3>
<p>Much of these are cribbed from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdE1lGoRnzj4HIuzlYdDq18FTYZ5s-Qxa1Mt0NR_cQM/edit#heading=h.u2c080bpff7f">Fated to Die</a> system, which is used by the <a href="https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/">Marked for Death</a> forum quest.</p>
<ul>
<li>XP gain: Players gain experience and use it to directly purchase skill levels and stunts.</li>
<li>Skill scale: Skill numbers are larger, roughly 10x compared to standard FATE.</li>
<li>Aspect Bonus: To work with the increased skill scale, invoking an Aspect gains you a variable bonus based on your skill.</li>
<li>Fudge Dice: To work with the increased skill scale, the values on Fudge dice are tripled to [-3, 0, +3].</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="list-of-magics">List of magics</h2>
<h3 id="water-magic"><a href="water-magic.html">Water magic</a></h3>
<p>Water mages have access to a pocket dimension which can store only pure water. They can form portals near the surface of their skin, through which they can eject or absorb water.</p>
<h3 id="library-magic"><a href="library-magic.html">Library magic</a></h3>
<p>Library mages form bonds to libraries and their genius loci, allowing them access to various magical effects while in the library.</p>
<h3 id="blood-magic"><a href="blood-magic.html">Blood magic</a></h3>
<p>Blood mages attune to the rhythm of their heartbeat and telekinetically control their blood. They are formidable foes in combat and very hard to bring down.</p>
<h3 id="illusion-magic"><a href="illusion-magic.html">Illusion magic</a></h3>
<p>Illusion mages create illusions that engulf all senses and are very hard to break out of.</p>
<h3 id="ink-magic"><a href="ink-magic.html">Ink magic</a></h3>
<p>Ink mages research and draw patterns in magical ink that can create a great variety of effects.</p>
<h3 id="blade-magic"><a href="blade-magic.html">Blade magic</a></h3>
<p>Blade-savants use their willpower to mystically amplify any cutting edge, allowing them to Cut nearly anything - not only physical objects (mundane or magical), but also abstract things such as time, space, lies, or justice. Nothing stands in the way of a master blade-savant.</p>
<h3 id="ice-magic"><a href="ice-magic.html">Ice magic</a></h3>
<p>Ice mages exploit an Ice Entity, an ancient imprisoned evil that desires a frozen death for the entire universe. Wisps of an Ice Entity’s power and consciousness leak out of its prison. Ice mages draw on these wisps. By sacrificing their own body heat, they draw an Ice Entity’s diffuse attention to a nearby location, sapping an equal amount of heat from there.</p>
<h3 id="fold-magic"><a href="fold-magic.html">Fold magic</a></h3>
<p>Fold mages crease, bend, and fold the fabric of the universe, allowing them to reshape space in ways both baffling and mundane. They are limited only by their skills and the inadequacy of their mind, as mortal brains are not made for gazing at spacetime from the outside.</p>
<h3 id="translation-magic"><a href="translation-magic.html">Translation magic</a></h3>
<p>Translation magic allows its users to understand information recorded in any language and nearly any format, as well as communicate in nearly any mode. They are even able to understand and speak the language of creation, allowing them to manipulate the script that underlies all reality.</p>
<h3 id="glass-magic"><a href="glass-magic.html">Glass magic</a></h3>
<p>Glass mages telekinetically control vitreous-phase matter (e.g. ordinary glass, obsidian, some forms of ice). They can also force some materials to transition into vitreous phase that wouldn’t otherwise.</p>
